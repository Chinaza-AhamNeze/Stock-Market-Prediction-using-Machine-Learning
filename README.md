# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
## Introduction
This project predicts stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of my learning journey in data science.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Overview
The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
2. **Model Training:** Training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as RMSE.

## Results
The model achieved an RMSE of X on the test set, indicating its ability to predict stock prices within a reasonable margin of error.

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was handling missing data effectively while ensuring the model's accuracy remained high.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements could include exploring more advanced algorithms or incorporating additional features like sentiment analysis of news data.

## Personal Reflection
This project taught me valuable skills in data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and result evaluation. It has strengthened my understanding of predictive modeling in financial markets.
